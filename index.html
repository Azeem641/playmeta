          This app is not connected to any government organization and is not an official source of information. The
          information provided in this app is for general purposes only and should not be taken as legal or professional
          advice. The creators of this app do not endorse any political party or agenda.

          The App app, developed by play meta Studio, is supported by ads. play meta Studio provides this service for
          free, as is. <br>

          This page explains my policies on collecting, using, and disclosing Personal Information if you choose to use
          my
          service.

          By using my service, you agree to the collection and use of information according to this policy. I collect
          Personal Information to enhance and improve the service. Your information will not be used or shared with
          others
          except as described in this Privacy Policy.

          The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which you can
          find
          in the App app unless stated otherwise here.

          <br><br><b>Collecting and Using Information:</b><br><br>

          To make the experience better, while using our service, I might need you to provide certain personal
          information
          like Device ID and Advertisement ID. The information you provide will stay on your device and won't be
          collected
          by me.

          The app uses third-party services that may gather information used to identify you.

          <br><br><b>Links to the privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the app:</b><br><br>

          <br><br><b>Logging Data:</b><br><br>

          I want to let you know that when you use my service and there's an error in the app, I collect data and
          information (via third-party products) from your device, known as Log Data. This Log Data may include things
          like your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, how the app was
          being used, the time and date of using the service, and other statistics.

          <br><br><b>Cookies:</b><br><br>

          Cookies are small bits of data commonly used as anonymous identifiers. They're sent to your browser from
          websites you visit and are stored on your device.

          My service doesn't explicitly use these "cookies." However, the app might use third-party code and libraries
          that use cookies to gather information and improve their services. You can choose to accept or decline these
          cookies and know when a cookie is sent to your device. If you decline our cookies, some parts of the service
          might not work properly.

          <br><br><b>Service Providers:</b><br><br>

          I might use third-party companies and individuals for:

          Assisting with the service
          Providing the service on my behalf
          Performing service-related tasks
          Helping analyze how the service is used
          These third parties can access Personal Information to perform tasks for us. However, they're not allowed to
          share or use the information for any other purpose.

          <br><br><b>Security:</b> <br><br>
          I value your trust in giving us your Personal Information, so I'm working to protect it using commercially
          acceptable means. But remember, no online transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure. I can't
          guarantee absolute security.

          <br><br><b>Links to Other Sites: </b><br><br>

          My service might have links to other websites. If you click on a third-party link, you'll go to that site.
          Remember, I don't control those external sites. It's wise to review their Privacy Policies, as I'm not
          responsible for their content, privacy policies, or actions.

          <br><br><b>Privacy for Children:</b><br><br>

          My service is not meant for anyone under 13 years old. I don't knowingly collect personal information from
          children under 13. If I discover a child under 13 has given me personal information, I'll remove it from my
          servers. Parents or guardians who know their child provided personal information should contact me.

          <br><br><b>Changes to This Privacy Policy:</b><br><br>

          I might update this Privacy Policy now and then. It's a good idea to check this page for changes. I'll inform
          you of changes by posting the new policy here.

          Effective Date of this Policy:

          This policy is effective from February 23, 2022.
